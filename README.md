# open-api-lifecycle
This is my test project to setup and play with the open api development lifecycle. 
I plan to follow swagger.io and open api 3.0 standards.

The project: This is not very clear at this point but plan to create some kind of stocks maangement API. Initially for someone to setup a protfolio of stocks to follow, upload time to 
time analysis on these stocks. Capture buy vs. hold vs. sell decision points etc. 

## Project Log - 8/5/2018
Since the goals of longer term API project are still forming and the main objective of the project
is to setup a good tool set to do modern API application development, we will start will setting 
up a portfolio of tracked stocks that someone can pull down for review.

# API lifecycle
Given that APIs have become the backbone of industry wide integrations, there is need to streamline the overall API development process. this part of the readme file captures the notes of the experience that I go through as I get deeper into this domain. 

## Lifecycle

## Discover and Design
This phase is when we explore the project, business capability or problem domain to outline the APIs that we might need. As we go through this discovery phase, we use the OpenAPI 3.0 yaml file to capture the API definition. On these lines, swagger editor is a good place to start. Being a single developer, I cloned the repository for swagger-editor (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor.git) and built it to run it locally.
