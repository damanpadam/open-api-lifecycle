# open-api-lifecycle
This is my test project to setup and play with the open api development lifecycle. 
I plan to follow swagger.io and open api 3.0 standards.

The project: This is not very clear at this point but plan to create some kind of stocks maangement API. Initially for someone to setup a protfolio of stocks to follow, upload time to 
time analysis on these stocks. Capture buy vs. hold vs. sell decision points etc. 

## Project Log - 8/5/2018
Since the goals of longer term API project are still forming and the main objective of the project
is to setup a good tool set to do modern API application development, we will start will setting 
up a portfolio of tracked stocks that someone can pull down for review.
